INVENTORIES:-
In Ansible, an inventory is the list of target machines (hosts or groups of hosts) that Ansible manages.
It tells Ansible what systems to connect to and what variables to use when running playbooks.
In the Inventory file(ini fille) we can list multiple hosts that could be used while performin g any action on all the hosts at once.
We can also create groups (e.g. centos(Group having all the centos machines), ubuntu(all the ubuntu machines) this helps when we want to run certain actions for same kind of hosts.
COMMANDS USED:
  1. ansible all -m ping ( here all represents all the mentioned hosts in hosts.ini file and -m represents module used i.e. ping in this case)
  2. ansible centos --list-hosts
  3. ansible ubuntu --list-hosts

MODULES:- 
Ansible modules are the building blocks of Ansible automation.
They are units of work (small programs) that Ansible runs on your managed hosts to perform tasks such as installing packages, managing files, configuring services, interacting with cloud providers, etc.
EX :- System modules : user, group, service, cron
      File Modules : copy, file, template, unarchive
      Package Mangement Modules : yum, apt, apk, dnf, pip
      Database Modules : mysql_db, mysql_user, postgresql_user, postgresql_db
      Networking modules : ios_config, netconf_config
      Utility Modules : assert, wait_for, debug

To see Available modules : ansible-doc -l         # List all modules
                           ansible-doc <module>   # Show details of a specific module
Commands to run : ansible all -m file -a 'path=/tmp/test state touch mode=600'
                  ansible all -m copy -a 'src=/tmp/abc.txt dest=/tmp/abc.txt'
