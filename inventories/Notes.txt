In Ansible, an inventory is the list of target machines (hosts or groups of hosts) that Ansible manages.
It tells Ansible what systems to connect to and what variables to use when running playbooks.
In the Inventory file(ini fille) we can list multiple hosts that could be used while performin g any action on all the hosts at once.
We can also create groups (e.g. centos(Group having all the centos machines), ubuntu(all the ubuntu machines) this helps when we want to run certain actions for same kind of hosts.
COMMANDS USED:
  1. ansible all -m ping ( here all represents all the mentioned hosts in hosts.ini file and -m represents module used i.e. ping in this case)
  2. ansible centos --list-hosts
  3.
